          Hi, I’m Neha! I’m a Computer Science graduate student at CU Boulder with a passion for building intelligent, scalable systems that bring together data, AI, and people. 
          I began my career at Deutsche Bank, where I developed data pipelines, automated testing frameworks, and CI/CD enhancements that streamlined financial reporting and improved engineering efficiency. 
          More recently at Splunk, I designed and deployed an AI-driven Smart Alert system built on 400k+ security alerts, complete with an interactive UI that balanced automation with analyst control. The project was recognized for its impact and showcased at .conf, Splunk’s global security and data conference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond professional roles, I enjoy creating projects that turn ideas into practical solutions such as VoxOff, a karaoke web app with real-time vocal separation and lyric alignment; NarrateNow, a service that generates chapter-wise audiobooks from EPUBs; and MoodyTunes, a music mood classifier trained on hundreds of thousands of Spotify and Last.fm tracks. I thrive at the intersection of software engineering, distributed systems, and machine learning, and I’m always exploring how technology can solve problems at scale. Along the way, I’ve also gained experience in mentoring and event planning, which taught me the importance of collaboration and communication alongside technical depth.
