                <h3>Detection of Mental Disorder on Social Platform</h3>
                <p class="conference">7th International Conference on Computing in Engineering & Technology (ICCET 2022) · Feb 13, 2022</p>
                <p class="description">
                    Mental disorders have significantly increased since the pandemic began, with issues like depression, anxiety, and suicidal tendencies on the rise. Our project aims to build a system that detects mental disorders using machine learning and deep learning techniques. By encouraging individuals to take an online survey, we can identify their mental state and connect them to counseling services. This early detection and connection to professional help can reduce suicide rates and improve overall mental health.

                <h3>Farming Made Easy using Machine Learning</h3>
                <p class="conference">2021 2nd International Conference for Emerging Technology (INCET) · May 21, 2021</p>
                <p class="description">
                    Agriculture is vital to our economy, but farmers face challenges from climate unpredictability and fluctuating crop prices. To assist, we developed an easy-to-use system that accurately predicts crop prices using Machine Learning's Decision Tree Regression Algorithm, considering factors like rainfall and wholesale price index. Additionally, the system offers weather forecasts, crop and fertilizer recommendations, and a chat portal, providing comprehensive support to farmers and enhancing their profitability.
